<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr>
<h1>MVP</h1>
<ul>Will include basic game that boots, sends get, updates leaderboard, and works. I have never done the fetch so I believe the get and bin aspects will be the most challenging.</ul>
<br>
<h1>Full</h1>
<ul>To contrast MVP full game will have a much more sense of competitiveness. 
  Wish to implement power ups, drops, health for both the enemies and user, an aspect of luck, and some sort of ability.
Along with general polish of code and scenery. </ul>
